In her previous positions, she has held roles such as Research Biology Intern at Olema Oncology and Undergraduate Researcher at UCLA, both of which involved significant research responsibilities. For instance, her internship at Olema Oncology involved investigating the effects of estrogen receptor modulation on breast cancer, which is a research-focused task. Similarly, her role at UCLA involved conducting research on yeast genetics, further supporting her qualifications as a researcher. 

While her title may not be one of the exact matches listed in the criterion, the responsibilities associated with her roles clearly indicate that she is engaged in research activities. Therefore, based on her current and past roles, Maleeha Madinawala satisfies the criterion of having a professional title or role as a researcher.

While none of these titles are an exact match for 'Researcher' or 'Principal Investigator', the criterion allows for equivalent titles and focuses on the actual responsibilities.

The criterion states that 'Research Project Manager (if the role description indicates hands-on research leadership)' can be an equivalent title. Although 'Honors Research Coordinator' is not 'Research Project Manager', the presence of 'Research' in the title is significant. Furthermore, her 'Science Teacher' role description explicitly mentions 'Honors Research in Science' as a current subject she teaches. This strongly suggests that her role as 'Honors Research Coordinator' involves coordinating, guiding, or overseeing research activities, particularly for students, which aligns with the responsibilities of a research-focused or research leadership role in an educational context.

The criterion also advises: 'For ambiguous or unfamiliar titles, review the role description for evidence of: - Leading research projects, managing research teams, or being responsible for research outcomes (PI equivalents) - Conducting, designing, or analyzing research (researcher equivalents)'. Given her role as 'Honors Research Coordinator' and teaching 'Honors Research in Science', it is reasonable to infer that her responsibilities include guiding and overseeing research, which aligns with the spirit of a researcher or principal investigator in an academic setting. Additionally, her past publication, 'New records of Sorex preblei and S. tenellus in California' (Jan 2006), further supports her background and engagement in research activities.

- Founding Executive Director at Discovery Learning Parners

None of these current titles are 'Researcher' or 'Principal Investigator', nor are they direct equivalents like 'Research Scientist' or 'Lead Scientist'. While her role as 'Founding Executive Director at Discovery Learning Parners' mentions co-authoring research and grant writing, the primary title itself does not indicate a research-focused role as per the criterion's examples.

Looking at her past experience, she held the title of 'Research Scientist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA)' from 1998 to 2002. The description for this role clearly states: '- Primary research involved a Case/Parental/Sibling Control Study of Ewing’s Sarcoma/Peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (pPNET)', '- Wrote and received study approval via IRB submission', '- Tested tissue samples', '- Collected tissue samples from hospitals nationwide', '- Participated on grant submissions'. This role directly aligns with the definition of a 'researcher' as it involved conducting, designing, and analyzing research.

The criterion states: 'Professional title or role is researcher or principal investigator'. It does not specify that the *current* role must be a researcher or principal investigator. Since she has held a professional title of 'Research Scientist', which is an accepted equivalent, she satisfies the criterion.

Additionally, her current projects, such as the Project IDEEM, focus on professional development for teachers, which may indirectly benefit high school students through improved teaching practices, although it does not explicitly mention direct involvement with high school students. However, her previous role in the MSTI PRISE Summer Internship for Math Teachers involved supporting credential candidates who were likely to work with high school students in a summer math camp. Overall, while there is clear evidence of her tutoring high school seniors, the direct involvement in projects specifically targeting high school students is less explicit. Therefore, I conclude that she meets the criterion based on her tutoring experience and potential indirect involvement through teacher training programs.
