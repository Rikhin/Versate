While 'Student Laboratory Assistant' is not a direct match for 'Researcher' or 'Principal Investigator', the criterion states to 'Accept both direct title matches and clear descriptions of research or PI responsibilities'.

In her role at the Gardner Lab, the description explicitly mentions 'Biology Education Research', 'Assists grad student with data collection, deidentification and coding', 'Analyzes effects of structured peer review', and 'Presented Preliminary Research Poster'. These activities clearly demonstrate research responsibilities.

Similarly, for her role at the Bernal Lab, the description states 'Aides in conducting research of frog-biting mosquitoes', 'Handles frog-biting mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae', 'Documents imaging of mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae', and 'Utilizes Excel to organize data'. These are also clear indications of research involvement.

The description further supports this, stating she 'Conducted extensive surveys', 'Developed an innovative procedure', 'Optimized detection methods', and 'Finalized comprehensive report and co-authored a scholarly article'.
*   **Biochemistry Research Assistant at University of Notre Dame**: Similar to the above, the title 'Research Assistant' is a direct match. The description details her research activities: 'Executed calibration tests', 'studied the relationships between voltage and current', 'Used ImageJ as primary software to analyze data', and 'Compiled all the relevant experimental data, analysis, and observations into a comprehensive report. Presented in front of current graduate students and professors. Contributed to poster shown at Summer Symposium at Notre Dame.'
*   **Independent Computer Science Researcher at University of Notre Dame**: The title 'Independent Computer Science Researcher' is a direct match for 'Researcher'. Her responsibilities included 'Collaborated with a Notre Dame professor to design a project', 'Worked to optimize a GPT-3 model', and 'Presented findings amongst several professors and postdoctoral graduates'.
*   **QuarkNet Summer Intern at University of Notre Dame**: Although an intern role, the description explicitly states she was 'Selected as 1 of 16 student researchers from across the state for QuarkNet, a nationally recognized program that connects high school students with cutting-edge physics research to collaborate with physicists and university faculty to explore data from real high-energy particle experiments'. This clearly indicates a research-focused role.

*   ""Distinguished Research Fellow at Lilly Research Laboratories"" (Since Aug 1988 - Present)
*   ""Distinguished Research Fellow at Eli Lilly and Company"" (Since 1988 - Present)

Both of these roles include the title ""Research Fellow"", which directly satisfies the criterion.

Cardinal Ritter High School is a high school. The role of a ""STEM Education Coordinator"" at a high school directly implies involvement in projects, programs, or research activities with high school students. This aligns perfectly with the criterion, which looks for involvement in such activities with high school students, including roles like ""organizing, coordinating, or directing programs, workshops, summer camps, internships, or competitions specifically for high school students"" and ""designing or running outreach or educational initiatives targeting high school students."" The title itself is strong evidence of this involvement.
