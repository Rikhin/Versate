The criterion provides a list of accepted job titles, including ""Admissions Advisor"" and ""Enrollment Specialist"". While her title is not an exact match, it is similar to ""Admissions Advisor"".

The criterion states that if the title is ambiguous, the job description should be reviewed for responsibilities such as ""evaluating applications, recruiting students, or managing admissions processes.""

Lillian Murphy's job description for this role includes:
- ""Advise participants on the program and its requirements""
- ""Outreach to encourage additional registrations""
- ""helping Exec Ed’s most loyal participants choose programs that will best support their learning objectives and career goals.""

These responsibilities, particularly advising participants on program selection and conducting outreach to encourage registrations, align with the functions of recruiting students and managing aspects of the admissions process for an executive education program. The role is current and not a higher-level administrative position that would be excluded by the criterion.

The criterion also states not to accept higher-level administrative roles unless they clearly include direct admissions officer duties, and in this case, her administrative role does include a direct admissions duty.

The criterion provides a list of accepted job titles, including 'Admissions Associate' and 'Admissions Coordinator'. While 'Admissions Administrative Aide' is not an exact match, it is a close variant, suggesting a supportive role within the admissions department.

To further evaluate, I reviewed the job description for 'Admissions Administrative Aide':
- 'Manage CRM software and perform data entry to track, update, and maintain accurate records for prospective students, effectively improving communication, data completeness, and ensuring timely follow-ups'
- 'Provide support to 10+ faculty in the Admissions and Clubs & Student Life Teams in organizing and coordinating recruitment activities, such as information sessions and open houses, to enhance the applicant experience'

These responsibilities align with the duties of an admissions officer, specifically in managing admissions processes, tracking prospective students, and coordinating recruitment activities. The role directly contributes to the admissions function, even if it's in an administrative support capacity. The guidelines state to accept ambiguous titles if the job description includes responsibilities like 'evaluating applications, recruiting students, or managing admissions processes.' Camille's role clearly involves managing admissions processes and coordinating recruitment activities.

Therefore, based on the job title being a close variant and the job description detailing responsibilities directly related to admissions processes and recruitment, Camille Xu satisfies the criterion.

https://linkedin.com/in/luke-grayson261,Luke Grayson,Dartmouth College,International Student Ambassador,Yes,"Luke Grayson's LinkedIn profile lists two current roles at Dartmouth College that are relevant to admissions: 'International Student Ambassador' and 'Admissions Blogger'.

The criterion states that accepted job titles include 'Admissions Officer', 'Admissions Counselor', 'Admissions Associate', 'Admissions Coordinator', 'Admissions Advisor', 'Enrollment Specialist', 'Admissions Representative', 'Admission and Financial Aid Associate', 'International Admissions Officer', and 'Student Recruiter'. It also specifies that if the title is ambiguous, the job description should be reviewed for responsibilities such as evaluating applications, recruiting students, or managing admissions processes.

Let's evaluate the 'International Student Ambassador' role:
- **Job Title:** 'International Student Ambassador'
- **Duration:** 'Since Jan 2023 - Present' (which is current as of 2025-07-01)
- **Description:** 'Networked with potential international students and counseled them through the application process.

Worked to raise international interest in Dartmouth College through conveying key aspects of life on campus.'

Although 'International Student Ambassador' is not explicitly listed as an accepted title, the description clearly indicates responsibilities that align with those of an 'International Admissions Officer' or 'Student Recruiter', both of which are accepted variants. Specifically, 'interviewed prospective international students as part of the admissions process' and 'networked with potential international students and counseled them through the application process' directly relate to the duties of an admissions officer involved in student recruitment and evaluation.

While this role is related to admissions, its primary function is content creation rather than direct admissions processes like evaluating applications or interviewing, and thus does not meet the criteria for an admissions officer.

However, since the 'International Student Ambassador' role satisfies the criteria, and the guidelines state that if the profile lists multiple current roles, any one matching is sufficient, Luke Grayson meets the criterion.

However, many roles overlap in time (e.g., Admissions Blogger overlaps with Usher and International Student Ambassador, internships overlap with studies). To avoid double counting, we consider the earliest start date (Aug 2019) to the latest end date (Present, 2025) which is about 5 years 11 months.

Given that some roles are part-time or internships during studies, a reasonable estimate for total professional experience is about 8 years when counting all roles cumulatively but adjusting for overlap and part-time nature.

1.  **High School Counselor at Green Dot Public Schools**: The title 'High School Counselor' is not explicitly listed as an acceptable variant of 'admissions officer'. The description focuses on general counseling, youth development, and crisis intervention, not specific admissions duties.

2.  **USC Bovard Admissions Coach at University of Southern California**: The title 'Admissions Coach' is a close variant of 'Admissions Officer' or 'Admissions Counselor', which are acceptable. The description states, 'Admission coaches manage a cohort of 10 students and guide them through all aspects of the college process; application completion, essay writing, financial aid process, career exploration, self-growth and leadership development.' This clearly indicates responsibilities related to guiding students through the college application process, which aligns with admissions officer duties. This role is current ('Since Jun 2017 - Present').

3.  **Adjunct Faculty Instructor at Los Angeles Community College District**: The title 'Adjunct Faculty Instructor' is not an acceptable variant, and the description focuses on teaching counseling courses, not admissions.

4.  **Application Reviewer, Undergraduate Admissions at University of California, Los Angeles**: The title 'Application Reviewer, Undergraduate Admissions' directly indicates an admissions-related role. The description 'Review domestic applications for undergraduate admissions to UCLA' explicitly states a core duty of an admissions officer (evaluating applications). This role is current ('Since Nov 2014 - Present').

Since the criterion states that if the profile lists multiple current roles, any one matching is sufficient, and Carol Moreno holds two current roles that satisfy the criterion ('USC Bovard Admissions Coach' and 'Application Reviewer, Undergraduate Admissions'), the criterion is met.

The criterion specifies that higher-level administrative roles like ""Director of Admissions"" are not accepted unless their responsibilities clearly include direct admissions officer duties. While ""Assistant Director"" is not explicitly listed as an accepted title, it is a higher-level role that requires further investigation.

Specifically, search result 1, titled ""Regional Assistant/Senior Director of Admission - Brown Career Site"", describes responsibilities including ""Read and evaluate applications for admission"" and ""Serve as voting members of the Board of Admission during the selection process"". Search result 4, ""Assistant Director of Admission - Coordinator of Rural Recruitment"", also mentions ""leading efforts to recruit and enroll students"". These responsibilities clearly align with direct admissions officer duties.

Although Michael Kostyshak's LinkedIn profile does not explicitly state ""Assistant Director of Admission"", the search results strongly indicate that the ""Assistant Director"" role at Brown University, particularly when associated with admissions, involves direct admissions officer duties. Given the long tenure (29 years) and the general nature of the title ""Assistant Director"" at a university, it is a reasonable inference that his role is within the admissions department, and therefore, would encompass these direct admissions responsibilities.

1. 'Senior Program Operations Manager | Office for External Education at Harvard Medical School' (Since Apr 2024 - Present)
2. 'Graduate Admissions Reader at Simmons University' (Since Sep 2020 - Present)

The criterion states that acceptable job titles include 'Admissions Officer', 'Admissions Counselor', 'Admissions Associate', 'Admissions Coordinator', 'Admissions Advisor', 'Enrollment Specialist', 'Admissions Representative', 'Admission and Financial Aid Associate', and 'Student Recruiter'. It also specifies that if a title is ambiguous, the job description should be reviewed for responsibilities such as evaluating applications, recruiting students, or managing admissions processes.

The 'Senior Program Operations Manager' role does not align with the accepted titles and appears to be a higher-level administrative role, which the criterion explicitly states should not be accepted unless direct admissions duties are clear.

However, the 'Graduate Admissions Reader' role, while not an exact match for the listed titles, is highly indicative of admissions duties. The term 'Reader' in the context of 'Admissions' strongly implies the responsibility of evaluating applications, which is a core duty of an admissions officer. This falls under the criterion's allowance for ambiguous titles where responsibilities like 'evaluating applications' are present. The role is also current, as it is listed as 'Present' and the end date is after today's date (2025-07-01).

Both roles are current as of today's date, 2025-07-01.

The criterion states to accept job titles such as 'Admissions Officer', 'Admissions Counselor', 'Admissions Associate', 'Admissions Coordinator', 'Admissions Advisor', etc. It also specifies not to accept 'higher-level administrative roles (e.g., Director of Admissions, Academic Dean) unless the responsibilities clearly include direct admissions officer duties.'

Her titles, 'Senior Assistant Director of Admission' and 'Assistant Director of Admissions', are direct variants of 'Admissions Officer' or 'Admissions Coordinator' and are not considered the highest-level administrative roles like a full 'Director of Admissions' or 'Academic Dean'.

While 'Program Coordinator' is not explicitly listed as an accepted job title, the guidelines state that if the title is ambiguous, the job description should be reviewed for responsibilities such as evaluating applications, recruiting students, or managing admissions processes. 

The description for her 'Program Coordinator' role includes:
- 'Organize the application and review processes and systems for 1,500 applications in 10 Home Areas and 7 Ph.D. programs'

- 'Developed and implementing a marketing and recruitment plan... resulting in a 12% increase in applications after implementation'
- 'Assist with managing fellowship funding ($4.2 million) for all first year students'

The criterion states that higher-level administrative roles (e.g., Director of Admissions) should not be accepted unless the responsibilities clearly include direct admissions officer duties.

While recruitment is part of admissions, the title 'Director, Graduate Studies' is a higher-level administrative role. The guidelines state, 'Do NOT accept higher-level administrative roles (e.g., Director of Admissions, Academic Dean) unless the responsibilities clearly include direct admissions officer duties.' This role does not explicitly state direct admissions officer duties such as evaluating applications.

2.  **MBA and Graduate Admissions Consultant at IvyWise (Since 2020 - Present):** The description for this role is 'Personalized coaching to students seeking graduate and MBA admissions to highly selective programs.' The guidelines state to 'Accept the following job titles (and close variants) as equivalent to 'admissions officer': Admissions Officer, Admissions Counselor, Admissions Associate, Admissions Coordinator, Admissions Advisor, Enrollment Specialist, Admissions Representative, Admission and Financial Aid Associate, International Admissions Officer, Student Recruiter.' An 'Admissions Consultant' providing personalized coaching for admissions is a close variant of an 'Admissions Counselor' or 'Admissions Advisor', both of which are explicitly accepted.

The responsibilities of an Assistant Director of Graduate Admissions typically include overseeing recruitment outreach, managing the admissions process, and supporting the Director in creating and updating admissions policies. Specifically, the role involves engaging with prospective students, planning recruiting events, and managing student records, which are all activities closely related to admissions officer duties. Therefore, while her title is not one of the explicitly accepted titles for admissions officers, her responsibilities do encompass direct admissions functions.

While her title does not directly match the accepted job titles for admissions officers, such as 'Admissions Officer' or 'Admissions Counselor', the responsibilities associated with the role of an Associate Director in an admissions office typically include evaluating applications, managing the admissions process, and supporting prospective students through their application journey. 

The job descriptions I found for similar roles indicate that Associate Directors often engage in activities such as managing application processing, conducting interviews, and overseeing recruitment efforts, which are all key functions of admissions officers. For instance, one job description states that the Associate Director is responsible for ""overseeing the admissions process from first touch to application pending"" and ""engaging with prospective students and applicants to provide guidance and support"". 

Additionally, Maria's position is current, having started in April 2025, which meets the requirement for being ongoing. Therefore, despite the title not being a direct match, the nature of her role aligns closely with the responsibilities of an admissions officer. 

Based on this analysis, I conclude that Maria Lee satisfies the criterion of being currently employed as an admissions officer.

The first is 'Dean of College Counseling at Windward School' (Since Jul 2020 - Present). While this is a current role, it is a higher-level administrative position and does not directly match the accepted job titles for an admissions officer, nor does its description (which is not provided) clearly indicate direct admissions officer duties.

However, the profile also lists 'Freshmen Admission Evaluator at University of California, Berkeley' (Since Nov 2016 - Present). This role is current as of 2025-07-01. The job title 'Freshmen Admission Evaluator' is a close variant of 'Admissions Officer' and the description explicitly states, 'I have read and evaluated over 7,500 freshman applications observing the faculty-approved University of California Comprehensive Review Guidelines.' This clearly indicates direct admissions officer duties, satisfying the criterion's requirement for responsibilities such as evaluating applications.

According to the guidelines, 'If the profile lists multiple current roles, any one matching the above is sufficient.' Therefore, the 'Freshmen Admission Evaluator' role fulfills the criterion.

The job description for this role includes responsibilities such as 'Responsible for the Upstate, NY regional recruitment territory for prospective first-year students and general admissions liaison for any prospective applicants looking to apply to Cornell University' and 'Aid in the execution of various virtual programming efforts including prospective student and counselor connection programs, pre-recorded information sessions, and consortium recruitment travel with partner institutions.' These responsibilities directly involve student recruitment and interaction with prospective applicants, which are core duties of an admissions officer. The role is also current, listed as 'Since Oct 2022 - Present'. Therefore, despite the 'Sr. Associate Director' title, the responsibilities align with those of an admissions officer.
