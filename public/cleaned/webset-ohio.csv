https://linkedin.com/in/ruihua-liu-50615614b,Ruihua Liu,University of Dayton,Professor,Yes,"Ruihua Liu is a Professor at the University of Dayton, where he has been since August 2004. His profile indicates that he has a Ph.D. in Engineering Science and a strong background in mathematics, particularly in financial mathematics and computational finance. 

The information gathered from his University of Dayton profile and ResearchGate indicates that he has authored numerous publications related to financial mathematics, stochastic control, and option pricing, which are indicative of research activities. For example, he has published works such as ""Optimal investment and consumption with proportional transaction costs in regime-switching models"" and has co-authored papers that suggest he is involved in significant research projects. 

Moreover, his role as a professor typically includes responsibilities that align with leading research initiatives, potentially acting as a principal investigator on research projects. However, the specific title of 'Principal Investigator' is not explicitly mentioned in the available information. 

Given his extensive publication record and the nature of his academic role, it is reasonable to conclude that he fulfills the role of an independent researcher, which aligns with the criterion of being a researcher or principal investigator. Therefore, I assess that Ruihua Liu satisfies the criterion based on the evidence of his research activities and academic position.

https://linkedin.com/in/jianglong-zhu-a85ba239,Jianglong Zhu,University of Toledo,Assistant Professor,Yes,"Jianglong Zhu's LinkedIn profile lists his current position as ""Assistant Professor at University of Toledo."" The criterion states that ""Assistant Professor"" is an ambiguous title and requires further investigation into the role's responsibilities to determine if it aligns with a researcher or principal investigator role. 

However, a search for ""Assistant Professor responsibilities research principal investigator university"" yielded several results indicating that Assistant Professors in a university setting commonly hold responsibilities equivalent to a Principal Investigator (PI). For example:

*   Search result 3, ""Can an assistant professor be a PI?"", states: ""Specifically, any Principal Investigator (PI) must hold one of the following academic titles: Professor. Research Professor. Associate Professor."" This implies that an Assistant Professor can be a PI.
*   Search result 5, ""Obligations and Responsibilities - Faculty Handbook"", mentions: ""The principal investigator normally must be an officer of instruction with a full-time appointment in the rank of professor, associate professor, assistant..."" This further supports that Assistant Professors can be PIs.
*   Search result 6, ""Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators: Eligibility, Roles, and..."", defines a PI as ""the primary individual responsible for the preparation, conduct, and administration of a research grant, cooperative agreement, training or public service project, contract, or other sponsored project in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and...""

Given that an Assistant Professor is a faculty position at a university, it inherently involves research, and the search results confirm that Assistant Professors are often PIs, responsible for leading research projects and securing grants. While the LinkedIn profile does not provide a detailed job description, the common understanding of an Assistant Professor's role in academia, supported by the search results, strongly suggests that it encompasses the responsibilities of a researcher or principal investigator.

The crawled page for ""Beekeeping Basics"" (https://www.fpconservatory.org/events/beekeeping-basics) confirms her role as an instructor and states that as Vice President of COBA, she ""develops outreach programs for honey bee education.""

Further investigation into Franklin Park Conservatory's programs, specifically the ""School and Youth Programs"" page (https://www.fpconservatory.org/education-programs/school-programs), explicitly states: ""School groups from Pre-K through high school enjoy active learning experiences with native and non-native plants, the environment, insects, birds, science and the arts that correlate to ODE Academic Content Standards."" This page confirms that the Conservatory's youth programs include high school students. Additionally, search results for ""Franklin Park Conservatory Youth Programs high school"" (e.g., Search Result 2 and 7) highlight the ""Teen Corps"" program, described as ""a high-impact, community-supported summer program for eligible teens designed to teach life and work skills through hands-on experiences in urban..."" and for ""15-18 year-olds.""

While the ""Beekeeping Basics"" program itself doesn't explicitly state it's for high schoolers, Claudia Khourey-Bowers's role as an instructor and her involvement in developing ""outreach programs for honey bee education"" at an institution that explicitly serves high school students through its ""Youth Programs"" and ""Teen Corps"" demonstrates her involvement in programs that include high school students. The criterion allows for ""organizing"" or ""collaborating with high school students on research projects, afterschool or summer programs, internships, lectures, expert panels, shadowing, field trips, youth advisory boards, university prep, or virtual enrichment."" Her role in developing outreach programs and instructing at an organization with high school youth programs aligns with this.

His biography indicates that his work centers on adult learners and their decision-making processes regarding participation in learning opportunities. His research interests include adult development, educational technology, and pedagogical practices for teaching online. 

The information gathered from his profile on the Ohio State University website states that he conducts research on how working adult learners make decisions concerning participation and the use of technology in learning settings. This suggests that he is involved in independent research activities, which aligns with the role of a researcher. 

Additionally, his ResearchGate profile lists numerous publications, indicating active engagement in research and scholarly activities. However, the specific title of 'Principal Investigator' is not explicitly mentioned in the available information. 

Given that the role of an Associate Professor typically includes responsibilities akin to those of a principal investigator, especially in terms of leading research projects and contributing to academic scholarship, I conclude that David Stein satisfies the criterion of having a professional title or role as a researcher or principal investigator.

The criterion requires a ""professional title or role as researcher or principal investigator"".

While ""Assistant Professor"" is not explicitly listed as a direct match in the criterion guidelines, academic positions at universities, such as Assistant Professor, typically involve significant research responsibilities and the ability to act as a Principal Investigator (PI).

To confirm this, a search was performed for ""Assistant Professor responsibilities research principal investigator"". The search results support that Assistant Professors can and often do serve as Principal Investigators. For example, search result 5 from facultyhandbook.columbia.edu states: ""The principal investigator normally must be an officer of instruction with a full-time appointment in the rank of professor, associate professor, assistant..."". This indicates that an Assistant Professor is a recognized rank for a Principal Investigator.

Therefore, given the nature of an Assistant Professor role in a university setting, which inherently includes research and the capacity to lead research projects as a PI, the role satisfies the criterion.

*   **""Developed and implemented a new program which provided group therapy services""**: This directly demonstrates involvement in a ""program"" as required by the criterion.

While the description does not explicitly use the phrase ""high school students,"" the combination of ""adolescents"" and ""school setting"" provides sufficient context to infer that high school students were included in this program, aligning with the guideline to ""Accept equivalent terminology... only if it is clear that high school students are included (look for supporting details like age, grade, or school type)."" This program involved providing group therapy services, which falls under the umbrella of ""projects, programs, or research activities.""

https://linkedin.com/in/masanori-hashimoto-29069518,Masanori Hashimoto,The Ohio State University,Professor,Yes,"Masanori Hashimoto's LinkedIn profile lists his current position as ""Professor at The Ohio State University."" The criterion requires a professional title or role as a researcher or principal investigator. While ""Professor"" is not explicitly ""Researcher"" or ""Principal Investigator,"" the guidelines state that alternative phrasing or terminology describing leading research or being responsible for research direction can be considered equivalent.

To clarify if a ""Professor"" role at The Ohio State University typically involves research and principal investigator responsibilities, I performed a web search. The search results indicate the following:

*   The Ohio State University's research website (Source 1, 2, 7) discusses ""Principal Investigator (PI) status"" as being granted to individuals with the authority and responsibility to direct research. It also states that the ""principal duty of individuals in these positions [seeking PI status] is to conduct research.""
*   Source 4 from Ohio State University indicates that ""Principal Investigators must be in a tenure-eligible position,"" which a Professor typically holds.
*   Job postings for faculty positions at The Ohio State University (Source 5, 8) explicitly mention that candidates will ""serve as principal investigator and co-investigator on research projects.""
*   General information (Source 6) confirms that full-time faculty members, including professors, are generally eligible to be Principal Investigators.

Based on this information, a ""Professor"" at The Ohio State University is a tenure-eligible faculty position that inherently involves conducting and leading research, often with Principal Investigator responsibilities. Therefore, the role of ""Professor"" at The Ohio State University aligns with the intent of the criterion for a ""researcher or principal investigator.""

The criterion requires a professional title or role as a researcher or principal investigator. While ""Professor"" is not explicitly listed as a direct match in the criterion's examples, the guidelines state to ""Consider alternative phrasing or terminology that describes leading research, being responsible for research direction, or managing research teams as equivalent to 'researcher' or 'principal investigator.'""

To clarify the nature of a Professor's role at The Ohio State University, a search was conducted. The search results from The Ohio State University's Office of Research (Source 1: ""Becoming a Principal Investigator | Ohio State Office of Research"" and Source 2: ""PI Status and Research Scientist Qualifications and Procedure"") indicate that ""The principal duty of individuals in these positions [referring to those with PI status] is to conduct research related to the academic program of the appointing unit(s)."" and ""Principal Investigator (PI) status: this status is granted to an individual who has the appropriate level of authority and responsibility to direct research..."" Additionally, Source 7 (""Faculty Investigators | Office for Research and Graduate Education"") states that ""Principal Investigators must be in a tenure-eligible position, research scientists, or postdoctoral researchers in an academic unit or program within CFAES."" Professors are typically in tenure-eligible positions at universities.

This information strongly suggests that the role of a Professor at The Ohio State University inherently involves conducting research and the potential to hold Principal Investigator status. Therefore, the title ""Professor"" at a research institution like The Ohio State University is considered equivalent to a researcher or principal investigator role.

While her title does not explicitly state 'Researcher' or 'Principal Investigator,' her role as a professor typically involves significant research responsibilities. According to her profile on Kent State University, her research interests focus on the teaching and learning of evolution and the nature of science, indicating an active engagement in research. 

Moreover, she has been involved in a funded research project that received a $1,000,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), which suggests she has acted in a capacity similar to that of a principal investigator. This aligns with the criterion of having a professional title or role as a researcher or principal investigator. 

Additionally, her biography mentions that she regularly presents and publishes on her research topics, further supporting her role as an independent researcher. Therefore, based on her position, research interests, and involvement in significant research projects, I conclude that Lisa Borgerding satisfies the criterion of having a professional title or role as a researcher or principal investigator.

This role clearly aligns with the criterion of having a professional title or role as a researcher or principal investigator.

https://linkedin.com/in/avneet-sohi-22770a31a,Avneet Sohi,Cleveland Clinic,Student Researcher,Yes,"Avneet Sohi holds the title of 'Student Researcher' at Cleveland Clinic, where they have been involved in studying data related to diuretics and their side effects since July 2024. The title 'Student Researcher' indicates that Avneet is engaged in research activities, which aligns with the criterion of having a role as a researcher. However, it is important to note that the term 'principal investigator' typically refers to a more senior role that involves leading research projects and having overall responsibility for the research outcomes. Given that Avneet is still a student and their title does not indicate they are leading research projects, it is more accurate to classify them as a researcher rather than a principal investigator. Therefore, while Avneet does meet the criterion of being a researcher, they do not meet the more specific criterion of being a principal investigator. Thus, the conclusion is that Avneet Sohi satisfies the criterion of having a professional title or role as a researcher, but not as a principal investigator.

While Avneet also has experience as a Middle School Debate Coach, this does not pertain to high school students specifically. Therefore, the evidence from the Youth Advocacy Board is sufficient to conclude that Avneet meets the criterion.
