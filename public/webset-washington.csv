For example, one search result mentions a ""Teen Center, which serves Bronx high school students ages 13-21"" (Source: search results for ""The College Access Project high school students"", Snippet 4) and another mentions ""enhanced academic support and social support to high school"" (Source: search results for ""The College Access Project high school students"", Snippet 7). Given the nature of a ""Mentor"" role in a ""College Access Project,"" it is highly probable that this involved high school students.

3.  **Tutor at HighSight Program (1998 - 2001)**:
    *   Search results for ""HighSight Program high school students"" explicitly state that HighSight ""provides partial four-year scholarships for eighth-grade students to attend private high schools in Chicago"" and ""provides scholarships, tutoring, mentoring, leadership development, and college readiness programs that create new possibilities for Chicago high..."" (Source: search results for ""HighSight Program high school students"", Snippet 1, 2, 4). This clearly indicates involvement with students who are either preparing for high school or are already in high school.

Based on the evidence, Tim St. Louis has demonstrated involvement in programs and activities with high school students through his volunteer work with the Wisconsin Association of School Councils and the HighSight Program. The College Access Project also strongly supports this conclusion.
